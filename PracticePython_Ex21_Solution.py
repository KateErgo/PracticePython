### Exercise 21: Write To A File ###

# Take the code from the How To Decode A Website exercise (if you didnâ€™t do it or just want to 
# play with some different code, use the code from the solution), and instead of printing the 
# results to a screen, write the results to a txt file. In your code, just make up a name for 
# the file you are saving to.

#   Extras:
#       1. Ask the user to specify the name of the output file that will be saved.
